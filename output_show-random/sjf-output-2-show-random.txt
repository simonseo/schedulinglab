The scheduling algorithm used was Shortest Job First

Process 0:
	(A,B,C,M) = (0,1,5,1)
	Finishing time: 9
	Turnaround time: 9
	I/O time: 4
	Waiting time: 0

Process 1:
	(A,B,C,M) = (0,1,5,1)
	Finishing time: 10
	Turnaround time: 10
	I/O time: 4
	Waiting time: 1

Summary Data:
	Finishing time: 10
	CPU Utilization: 1.000000
	I/O Utilization: 0.800000
	Throughput: 20.000000 processes per hundred cycles
